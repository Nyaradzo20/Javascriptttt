# Drone Delivery Simulator

## Overview

This project simulates a drone delivery system designed to transport essential medicines from city hubs to remote villages in Zimbabwe. It operates on a simplified 2D coordinate grid where drones pick up medicine packages at hubs and deliver them to designated villages.

## Features

* **Hub and Village Objects:**
  Each hub has a name, coordinates, and a list of villages it serves. Villages are defined by their names, coordinates, and required medicines (e.g., tetanus, malaria, flu meds).

* **Drone Class:**
  Models drones with properties like name, speed, battery life (lasting up to 48 hours), and current position. Drones can move, deliver packages, and return to hubs for recharging.

## WHAT I HAVE LEARNT:
* OOP(classes,methods,constructor)
* arrays
